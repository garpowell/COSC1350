			<p>I have been mountain biking for over forty years but I was starting to think
				I was going to have to give it up. It was getting too hard to make it up the hills
				and long rides were getting harder and harder to do. Then I got an ebike. It changed
				my life and made mountain biking fun again. I made this page and my youtube channel
				to share my experience.</p>
