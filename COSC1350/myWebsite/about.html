				<h2>About Me</h2>

				<p>I am a teacher by profession but I try to spend as much time as I can mountain biking.
					It helps me keep my sanity. My uncle who was a teacher always said the best thing about
					teaching is June, July and August. I have to admit it is a big benefit of being a teacher
					and I spend a lot of time over the summer on my bikes.</p>

				<p>As I got older mountain biking got harder and it was not as fun. Then I got an ebike
					and that made it fun again. Ebikes are a game changer. You need to try one if you have 
					not. If you think you are too old to mountain bike, get an ebike and go have some fun. 
					That is what this page is all about. Ebikes changed my life let them change yours. 
					Remember if I can get out and ride you can get out and ride.</p>
